# Customer-Lifetime-Value-of-Google-Merchandise-Store
Objective:
This project aims to select the best model for Google Merchandise Store to predict the customer lifetime value of their newly acquired customers within 90 days after being acquired.

Key Highlight:
- Our group utilized the big Query to derive some important website metrics from Google Analytics dataset of Google Merchandise Store. 
- For variable selection, we stand in customers' viewpoint and try to determine what features might affect them to make their purchase on Google Merchandise Store, considering factors such as geography, time, action, psychology, customer browsing habits, customer action, etc. And we created these new variables based on speculation to confirm the effects in the model.
- Applied various of machine learning method through Google Colab, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost. We evaluated the model performance based on prediction error (MAE).
- XGBoost regression model turned out to significantly reduced the prediction error by more than 40% .
